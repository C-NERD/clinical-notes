- There is increase in serum phosphate levels due to kidney failure
- In response to this osteocytes and osteoblasts secrete fibroblast growth factor 23
- FGF 23 simulates down regulation for serum phosphate by:
	- Promoting increased phosphate excretion by the remaining healthy glomeruli
	- Inhibiting vitamin D activation and promoting vitamin D metabolism to cause vitamin D deficiency
- Since vitamin D is responsible for intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium, deficiency of vitamin D causes
